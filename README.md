#True Effort

A website for UW-Madison Students, acts as a database where students can leave reviews of each class and let others know about
class structure, study time needed per week, the effort needed for the overall class, and much more. This would help students
know whether their planned schedule would be too much for them or not. The database aims to accurately represent the actual course
load, because the number of credits the class is worth isn't always the true effort needed for the class.
