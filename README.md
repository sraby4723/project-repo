First commit file for the project repository. This project will be an application of some sort,
but beyond that I am not too certain on what this project might entail. We might end up doing
a cross platform application if it isn't that hard to implement, but it will definitely support
Linux natively

Possible project idea: A program to help users divy up time for different classes to study based on course load, credit number,
and other factors. Could possibly make a database where students can tell each other abount the load of certain classes and what 
to expect in order to study.
